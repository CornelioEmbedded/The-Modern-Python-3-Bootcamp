# 32 - Web Scraping with BeautifulSoup

## Introduction to Web Scraping
- Web scraping involves programmatically grabbing data from a web page
- Three steps: Download, extract data, use data

### Why Scrape?
- There is data on a site that you want to store or analyze
- You cant get by other means
- You want to programmatically grab the data (instead of lots of manual copying/pasting)

### Is it ok??
- Some websites dont want people scraping them
- Best practice: consult the robots.txt file
- If making many requests, time them out
- If you are too aggressive, your IP can be blocked
